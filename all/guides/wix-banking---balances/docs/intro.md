### Wix Banking Balances API Intro


The Balances API is designed to help you reflect bank account balances.

Every bank account has next balances:
- current balance - funds that are currently in the account
- authorization hold - represents funds that are not available for spending, due to an outstanding card authorization
- available - balance available for spending. Equals the balance minus the authorization_hold amount.
