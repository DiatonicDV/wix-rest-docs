# Items Selection: Sample Use Cases & Flows

This article presents sample flows your app can support. You aren't limited to this exact flow, but it can be a helpful jumping off point as you plan your Items Selection integration.

## Add luxurious jewelry to an eCommerce order page

A Wix site owner has a mid-priced jewelry store. The store has a small group of high end clients, to which it provides luxury jewelry from an outsourced supplier. Rather than displaying the luxury jewelry on the store's site, the outsourced supplier can integrate with the Wix Items Selection SPI, making the luxury items available on the eCommerce Order page in the Wix dashbaord. The site owner can then add the luxury items to the high end client's order. 

1. A high end client wants to purchase luxury jewelry. In this case, the client wants earrings.

2. Wix sends a [Query Items](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/items-selection-spi/query-items) SPI request to your app to query the luxury jewelry items for a list of earrings. The response is a list of earrings.

3. A Wix site owner sees the list of earrings, selects the desired item from the list, and adds it to the order.
