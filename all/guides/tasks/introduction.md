# About Tasks

The Tasks API allows you to create and manage tasks. You can organize and prioritize daily task activities, such as follow up calls and emails, or scheduling meetings. 

With Tasks you can:
- Create, update, and delete tasks. 
- Link tasks to a contact.
- Create reminder notifications by setting a due date for tasks. 
- Prioritize tasks by adjusting their display order.
- Retrieve tasks.
- Count how many tasks you have based on specified filters.

## Task reminders

When you set a due date for a task, reminder notifications are sent on:
- The day before the due date. 
- The due date. 

Reminder notifications are not sent for overdue tasks.
