# Introduction

The Loyalty Rewards API allows you to manage rewards that customers can redeem with their loyalty points. For example, you can create a reward that is redeemed for a coupon for free shipping or for a coupon with a discount that applies to an entire purchase.

With the Loyalty Rewards API, you can [create](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-loyalty-program/rewards/create-reward) and [update](https://dev.wix.com/api/rest/wix-loyalty-program/rewards/update-reward) the rewards you offer.

## Terminology
