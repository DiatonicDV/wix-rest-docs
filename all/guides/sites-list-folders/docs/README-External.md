The Site Folders API enables the management of sites in an account by organizing them into folders.

With the Wix Folders APIs you can query the list of folders in the account, update, delete and create new folders. 
You can also get a parent folderâ€™s ID by site ID, and you can move sites and folders between folders.

Site owners and contributors can also manage their sites and folders via the [My Sites](https://manage.wix.com/account/sites) page.
