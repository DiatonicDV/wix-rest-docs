# About Ads.txt

With Wix Ads.txt, site owners can define which **A**uthorized **D**igital **S**ellers are allowed to sell digital advertisements on their site. This enables them to increase revenue, while ensuring security, privacy, and transparency. 

The Ads.txt APIs allow your app to:

- Retrieve an existing Ads.txt file
- Append data to and update Ads.txt
- Re-set Ads.txt to Wixâ€™s default state

The Ads.txt project is a simple, flexible, and secure method for publishers and distributors to declare authorized sellers. Read more about Ads.txt and its functionality on the [website of the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB)][IABwebsite].
