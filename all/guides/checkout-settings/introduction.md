# About Checkout Settings

With the Checkout Settings API, you can retrieve and update the checkout settings for sites that have installed your app. These settings include adding or removing eCommerce policies, and setting checkbox behavior for a checkout.    

Policies will appear as clickable links in the footer of your checkout, while checkboxes can be found when selecting the payment method. Clicking on the policy name opens a pop-up window with the policy text. The default checkout settings are provided when you first create a Wix eCommerce site. 

## Before you begin
