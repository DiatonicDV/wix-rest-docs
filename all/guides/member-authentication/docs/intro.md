# About Members Authentication

The Members Authentication API
allows your app to trigger an email
that prompts a site member to set their password.
This API can be used for new or existing site members.

## Example Flow

This API can be used with [Create Member][create-member]
(in the [Members API][members-api])
to import members from an external tool or service.
For more information, see [Importing Members][import-member-flow].
