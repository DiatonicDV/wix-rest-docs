# About Form Submissions

With Wix Form Submissions, site owners can manage individual form submissions from site visitors. 


The Form Submissions API provides flexibility in managing form submission data and allows your app to: 
- Query and manage submissions for a specified form
- Retrieves the total number of permissions per form
- Supports the ability to upload media files to a [media manager folder](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/api-reference/media/media-manager/introduction) when forms include "file upoad" fields
