# About the Order Invoices API

The Order Invoices API allows you to retrieve the IDs of invoices, and IDs of the external invoice apps that created them.

With the Order Invoices API, you can retrieve invoice IDs and external invoice app IDs associated with [one or more orders](https://dev.wix.com/docs/rest/api-reference/wix-e-commerce/order-invoices/list-invoices-for-multiple-order).


## Terminology

+ __Invoice ID__: Used to retrieve the invoice itself from the service that created it.
+ __Invoice App ID__: ID of the external invoice app that created the invoice.
