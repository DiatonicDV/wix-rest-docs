# About the eCommerce Checkout Templates API

The Checkout Templates API allows you to create and manage pre-populated checkouts to share with customers. When customers then create checkouts from these templates, the new checkouts already include information such as predefined line items, coupons, or other customizations.

With the Checkout Templates API, you can:
+ Run a sale on a specific product for a limited time
+ Customize the checkout experience


## Before you Begin

It’s important to note that the checkout template functionality is not currently available in the Wix Dashboard. If a site creates checkout templates with an app, they must also be able to manage and update their checkout templates through an app. For example, a website offering a sale through a checkout template must be able to change the template’s `status` to `INACTIVE` or they will not be able to turn off the sale when they want it to end.
