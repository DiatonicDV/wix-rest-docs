# About Wix Coupons  
Wix site owners can create coupons to provide their customers with discounts on the products on their site.  
With the Coupons API, you can integrate with the site owner's coupon management in their Wix site to create, delete, get, check and query the site owner's coupons.

  <strong>Important:</strong><br/>
Wix site owners retain full access to their sites and may make changes that affect the viability of the coupons you create (e.g., deleting a product for which your platform has an active coupon). At the current time, there is no way to receive notifications about such changes. </p>
