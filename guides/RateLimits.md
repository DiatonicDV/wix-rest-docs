# Rate Limits

> Important:  
Wix API limits are *per [instance](https://devforum.wix.com/en/article/identifying-your-users)*.

Wix API rate limits allow an app to perform up to 200 requests per minute, per [instance](https://devforum.wix.com/en/article/identifying-your-users). 
If this limit is exceeded, the app may be throttled - and API requests made by a throttled app will fail.
