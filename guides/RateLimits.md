# Rate Limits  


> Important:  
Wix API limits are per [instance](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/access/app-instances/about-app-instances).

Wix API rate limits allow an app to perform up to 200 requests per minute, per [instance](https://dev.wix.com/docs/build-apps/develop-your-app/access/app-instances/about-app-instances). 
If this limit is exceeded, the app may be throttled - and API requests made by a throttled app will fail.
