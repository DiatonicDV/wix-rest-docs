# About FQDNs

A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is a unique identifier assigned to each Wix service entity.

For example, the Wix eCommerce Cart entity's FQDN is: `wix.ecom.v1.cart`.

An entity's FQDN is returned in every webhook (except for [legacy webhooks]()) and can be required in endpoints that work with entities from other Wix services.
