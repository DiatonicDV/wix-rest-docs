# Permissions

The [permissions](https://devforum.wix.com/en/article/about-permissions) you select in the Wix Developers Center will dictate which type of authorization site owners will provide and which data you can access. Site owners will be asked to authorize the permissions you've requested during the [installation flow](https://dev.wix.com/api/getting-started#authentication).

  <strong>Important:</strong><br/>
Never ask for more permissions than the ones required for your app to function as intended. Determine the scope of your app permissions thoroughly before requesting permissions in the Wix Developers Center.
