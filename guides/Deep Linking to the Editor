## Custom Element Settings Panel

The custom element is an app component that adds visual control objects  as well as a settings panel. When an app with a custom element  is installed, whether by deep link or not, the settings are passed into the settings panel on the user's stage. The user can change the settings but you maintain access to them.

A custom element can be added to your app by selecting **Components > Website Component > Web component**:
