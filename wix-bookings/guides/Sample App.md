# Wix Bookings Sample App

We have created a [sample app](https://github.com/wix/bookings-list-sample-application) for you to use for the Wix Bookings REST API.  

![Bookings Sample App](../../media/wix-bookings-sample-app.gif)

It enables you to:
* View all bookings in a list format (instead of calendar)
* Filter the view by date and/or status
* Update attendance and payments directly from this list.

##  API Endpoints List
