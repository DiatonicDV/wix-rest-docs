# Wix Bookings Sample App

We have created a [sample app](https://github.com/wix/bookings-list-sample-application) for you to use for the Wix Bookings REST API.  

![Bookings Sample App](http://g.recordit.co/n1PIWIrfF9.gif)

<!-- ![Bookings Sample App](../../media/wix-bookings-sample-app.gif). -->

It enables you to:
* View all bookings in a list format (instead of calendar)
* Filter the view by date and/or status
* Update attendance and payments directly from this list.

To run the app on your site, clone the the repo and add it to your developer's center as explained [here](https://github.com/wix/bookings-list-sample-application).
