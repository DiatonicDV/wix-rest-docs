## Terminology
- **The catalog** is a complete list of all the storeâ€™s products - compiled automatically. 
- **Collections** are themed groupings of items for purchase that a store owner can create to organize their products (e.g., Spring 2019, Running shoes, etc.). Products can belong to multiple collections.
- **Options** are property types that customers can select within the specific product - e.g., color and size. 
- **Selections** are the types available within each option - e.g., red and green selections under the Color option. 
- **Choices** are the specific choices the customer has made within a selection - e.g., choosing the red Selection triggers the red Choice.  
- **Variants** are combinations of  different product choices - e.g., a red shirt in size large.
A variant can override the following values from the parent product:
  - Price
  - SKU
  - Weight
  - Inventory
